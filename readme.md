Run Length Encoder
=

This is a school project that I'm extending into my own project. This should be both windows / unix compatible and easily transformable between the two.

This project should include a compressor / decompressor and should allow for the easy manipulation of a single file or a single directory.

Manipulation should be either through the compression of an element, or the de-compression of an element. We are using the run-length algorithm for this compression.
